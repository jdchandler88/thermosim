# thermosim
Simulation of heat transfer. The goal is to be able to use this simulation to predict how long to boil a kettle of water, how much boil-off / time, etc. The intention is to be able to tune a brewing PID controller without actually boiling water. Also, it will help with crafting recipes with varying outdoor conditions.
